# spatial_data_science_reps

Short exercises for gaining "reps" and building fluency in spatial data science-related tasks.

Designed to be used in conjunction with the [GIS 5571: ArcGIS I _(Spatial Data Science I)_](https://github.com/runck014/spatial_data_science_course) course at the University of Minnesota, taught by Dr. Bryan Runck.

Based off of Dr. Eric Shook's teaching method, described in further depth [here](https://globetogates.substack.com/p/reps-a-teaching-method-for-basic).

These exercies are specifically intended to provide fluency in common programming tasks that may need to be used in GIS 5571 and more broadly in spatial data science-related problems. They also intend to showcase that there are a myriad of possible outcomes and solutions and being aware of these possiblities is valuable.
