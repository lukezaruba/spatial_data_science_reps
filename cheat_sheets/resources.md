# Resources for Getting Started

## ArcGIS Online

ArcGIS Online is a great tool for working with data online, making web maps, and even using Notebooks.

To access the U's ArcGIS Online, you will simply need to login with you typical UMN credentials.

The website is listed below.

## ArcGIS Pro

ArcGIS Pro is the main software that you will need to use this semester. Make sure you have a reliable way to access it early on, so that you can try and mitigate against any issues when the labs come out.

There are a couple different options for accessing ArcGIS Pro. The easiest is to simply login to one of the U's computers in a GIS computer lab (there are several around campus that have GIS software already installed).

For Windows users, you can also install ArcGIS Pro directly on your machine. Instructions for how to do this are linked below.

For Mac users and others who simply do not want to install ArcGIS Pro locally on their machines, you can login to a University machine via AppsToGo. If you prefer to use this option, reach out and we can help you with this if need be.

## IDEs

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a place that you can write code, similarly to any text editor. The difference between IDEs and text editors (like Notepad or Sublime Text) is that IDEs have advanced support for actually writing code. They are specifically designed to make developers as productive as possible.

If you choose to use an IDE, which is completely optional, Visual Studio Code is often a good choice that is relatively easy to get set up.

If you do not use an IDE, then you can simply make use of the Notebooks functionality in ArcGIS Pro (and ArcGIS Online, but this can be a little more complicated if you are trying to use ArcPy).

Several resources for this can be found below.
